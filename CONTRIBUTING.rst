Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `planetmint-driver-ts`_ for local
development.

1. Fork the `planetmint-driver-ts`_ repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally and enter into the project::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/planetmint-driver-ts.git
    $ cd planetmint-driver-ts/

3. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. Write tests ;-)

5. Test!

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.


Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for JS and node. Travis or others would be an interesting
   way for automate the tests...
